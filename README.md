## 👋 Hi! I'm David Villanueva

I'm a data analyst transitioning into Data Science, with a strong foundation in finance, advanced analytics, and machine learning. I've completed a data science bootcamp, an IBM Data Science Specialization, and applied my knowledge through diverse projects involving predictive modeling, computer vision, time series forecasting, NLP, and business-focused data analysis.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using data, modeling, and impactful storytelling.
