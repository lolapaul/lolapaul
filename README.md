## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm David Villanueva

I'm a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in finance, advanced analytics, and machine learning.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through data modeling and compelling storytelling. The projects in this GitHub profile explore applications across various industries, including:


- **Finance and Fintech**
- **Retail and E-commerce**
- **Consumer Behavior Analytics**
- **Housing and Real Estate**
- **Music Streaming and Entertainment**

**Technologies and tools I use:**

- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **SQL**: for querying structured data  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter, Google Colab  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub  
- **Dashboards and Reports**: Power BI (when applicable), Excel, Google Sheets  

Feel free to explore my repositories â€” each one includes a detailed `README.md` explaining the project scope, tools used, and key insights.

##  Featured Projects

| Project | Objective | Technologies |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/lolapaul/movie-review-sentiment-analysis) | Build a binary classification model to automatically detect negative film reviews using labeled data from IMDB. Explore different modeling techniques and analyze their ability to generalize to unseen reviews. | NLP, TF-IDF, scikit-learn |
| [ Age Detection via Computer Vision](https://github.com/lolapaul/age-estimation-cnn) | Develop a deep learning model that estimates a person's age from their photograph to determine if they are legally eligible to purchase alcohol. | TensorFlow, Keras, ResNet50 |
| [ Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/lolapaul/customer-churn-prediction) | This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn for Interconnect, a telecom provider. The company wants to proactively identify customers likely to leave and offer them retention incentives. | pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost |
| [ Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/lolapaul/used-car-price-prediction) | Machine learning project to predict the market price of used cars. | LightGBM, Random Forest, pandas |
| [ Instacart Behavior Analysis](https://github.com/lolapaul/instacart-customer-behavior-analysis) | Exploratory data analysis of a modified Instacart dataset to uncover customer behavior and shopping habits. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
| [ Chicago Taxi & Weather Analysis](https://github.com/lolapaul/chicago-taxi-analysis) | This project analyzes Chicago taxi data to explore trip patterns, company performance, neighborhood demand, and weather impactsâ€”specifically testing if rain affects travel time. | SQL, pandas, seaborn |
